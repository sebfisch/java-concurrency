# Actor Systems

## Task: Implement echo server

The class `EchoServer` defines `Request` and `Response` types
for actors that echo sent text back to their sender.
Implement the corresponding behavior
receiving `Request` messages and sending back a `Response` with the same text
before waiting for new messages.

Add a test to the `EchoTests` class
demonstrating that the server behaves as intended.
